# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Create your own [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) of the repo
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate
feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch. This allows me to
review and pull in new features or improvements individually.
